# Predicting-Document-Publication-Date-From-Homograph-Sense

Word sense disambiguation is an important technique used in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. The task is more challenging when working with homographs as the context is required to understand the sense of the word. Another important topic in NLP is finding the temporal relation of text or events. In this article, we consider the senses of homographs present in documents from the Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus and train a machine learning model to try to predict the document publication date. We also investigate a way to predict the publication year for documents without sense annotation by using the context of the homographs.
